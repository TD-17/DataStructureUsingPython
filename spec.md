# Backend Engineering Plan for Prescription Data Extraction System

## Introduction
This document outlines the role of backend engineers in developing a system that processes doctors’ prescriptions to extract specific data (disease, prescription, doctor) using a Large Language Model (LLM) and delivers this data to multiple hospitals via APIs or a website. The system ensures data privacy, with each hospital’s data isolated and encrypted, and supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests. Backend engineers will integrate the LLM model’s output, referred to as the “formula,” to enable this functionality.

## Role of Backend Engineers

Backend engineers are tasked with building a secure, scalable, and efficient infrastructure to handle prescription data, integrate with the LLM model, and ensure compliance with privacy and security requirements. Their responsibilities include:

### 1. API Development
Backend engineers will create RESTful APIs to facilitate data exchange between hospitals and the system. Key endpoints include:

- **Upload Prescription Endpoint**: Allows hospitals to submit prescription data (e.g., text or PDF).
- **Retrieve Data Endpoint**: Enables hospitals to access extracted data (disease, prescription, doctor).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement OAuth 2.0 or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure only authorized users from each hospital can access their data.
- **Multi-Tenant Design**: Use tenant IDs to associate data with specific hospitals, ensuring isolation.

**Example API Structure**:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Parameters | Response |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| `/upload-prescription` | POST | Uploads prescription text | `tenant_id`, `text` | `{ "status": "success", "prescription_id": 123 }` |
| `/get-data` | GET | Retrieves extracted data | `tenant_id` | `[{ "prescription_id": 123, "disease": "Diabetes", "prescription": "Metformin 500mg", "doctor": "Dr. Smith" }]` |

### 2. Integration with the LLM Model
The “formula” from the LLM model is likely a trained model for named entity recognition (NER), deployed as an API by ML engineers. Backend engineers will integrate this model as follows:

- **API Calls**: Send prescription text to the LLM model’s API and receive structured data (e.g., JSON with extracted entities).
- **Data Processing**: Parse the API response and store the extracted entities in a database, associated with the hospital’s tenant ID.
- **Error Handling**: Implement retries and fallbacks for API failures.

**Example Integration** (using Python with FastAPI):

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import requests

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/upload-prescription")
async def upload_prescription(text: str, tenant_id: str):
    # Call LLM model API
    llm_response = requests.post("https://ml-service/extract-entities", json={"text": text})
    if llm_response.status_code == 200:
        extracted_data = llm_response.json()
        # Store in database (pseudo-code)
        store_in_db(tenant_id, extracted_data)
        return {"status": "success"}
    else:
        return {"status": "error", "message": "Failed to extract entities"}
```

### 3. Data Management and Security
To ensure data privacy and compliance, backend engineers will implement:

- **Encryption**:
  - **In Transit**: Use HTTPS for all API communications.
  - **At Rest**: Apply field-level encryption for sensitive fields (e.g., prescription details) in the database.
- **Tenant Isolation**:
  - Store each hospital’s data in separate database schemas or with tenant-specific keys.
  - Example database table:

| tenant_id | prescription_id | disease   | prescription      | doctor     |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| hospital_1| 1               | Diabetes  | Metformin 500mg   | Dr. Smith  |
| hospital_2| 2               | Hypertension | Lisinopril 10mg | Dr. Jones |

- **Access Control**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access to authorized users within each hospital.
- **Data Anonymization**: If required, anonymize sensitive data before processing, though this may complicate LLM integration.

### 4. Handling Synchronous and Asynchronous Requests
The system must support both immediate and background processing:

- **Synchronous Requests**:
  - Process the prescription immediately, call the LLM model, and return extracted data.
  - Suitable for small, real-time requests.
- **Asynchronous Requests**:
  - Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle large or time-consuming tasks.
  - Example: A hospital uploads a batch of prescriptions, the backend queues them, processes them in the background, and notifies the hospital via webhooks when complete.

**Example Async Workflow**:
1. Hospital sends a batch of prescriptions to `/upload-prescription-batch`.
2. Backend adds tasks to a message queue.
3. Worker processes dequeue tasks, call the LLM model, and store results.
4. Hospital is notified via a webhook or polls `/get-data`.

### 5. Scalability and Performance
To handle multiple hospitals and large data volumes, backend engineers will:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) to scale the application.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple servers.
- **Caching**: Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., recent extractions).
- **Monitoring**: Implement tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor performance and detect bottlenecks.

### 6. Error Handling and Logging
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry mechanisms for LLM API calls and database operations.
- **Logging**: Log all requests and errors for auditing, ensuring logs exclude sensitive data.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts for critical failures (e.g., LLM API downtime).

### 7. Deployment and Maintenance
- **Deployment**: Host the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- **CI/CD**: Use continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automated testing and updates.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches.

## How Backend Engineers Use the LLM Model’s Formula

The LLM model’s “formula” is the trained NER model that extracts entities from prescription text. Backend engineers will use it as follows:

### Workflow
1. **Receive Prescription**: A hospital uploads prescription data via the `/upload-prescription` endpoint.
2. **Call LLM Model**: The backend sends the text to the LLM model’s API, receiving a response like:
   ```json
   {
     "disease": "Diabetes",
     "prescription": "Metformin 500mg",
     "doctor": "Dr. Smith"
   }
   ```
3. **Store Data**: The backend stores the extracted entities in a database, encrypted, under the hospital’s tenant ID.
4. **Serve Data**: The hospital retrieves its data via the `/get-data` endpoint, seeing only its own records.

### Integration Options
- **API-Based**: The ML team hosts the LLM model as a REST or gRPC API, and the backend makes HTTP requests to it.
- **Local Deployment**: If the model is lightweight, it could be deployed within the backend application, but this is unlikely for LLMs due to computational requirements.
- **Tools and Frameworks**: Use frameworks like FastAPI (Python) or Node.js for API development, as they are well-suited for integrating with ML models ([Top Backend Frameworks](https://slashdev.io/blog/top-backend-frameworks-for-llm-integration-in-2025)).

### Example Code
Below is a sample FastAPI implementation for integrating with the LLM model:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class PrescriptionInput(BaseModel):
    tenant_id: str
    text: str

class PrescriptionOutput(BaseModel):
    prescription_id: int
    disease: str
    prescription: str
    doctor: str

@app.post("/upload-prescription", response_model=dict)
async def upload_prescription(input: PrescriptionInput):
    try:
        # Call LLM model API (hypothetical URL)
        llm_response = requests.post("https://ml-service/extract-entities", json={"text": input.text})
        llm_response.raise_for_status()
        extracted_data = llm_response.json()
        
        # Store in database (pseudo-code)
        prescription_id = store_in_db(input.tenant_id, extracted_data)
        
        return {"status": "success", "prescription_id": prescription_id}
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"LLM API error: {str(e)}")

@app.get("/get-data", response_model=list[PrescriptionOutput])
async def get_data(tenant_id: str):
    # Retrieve data from database (pseudo-code)
    data = retrieve_from_db(tenant_id)
    return data
```

## Security Considerations
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS and database encryption to protect data. If end-to-end encryption is required (where the service cannot see the data), hospitals would need to encrypt data client-side, but this may prevent LLM processing unless decryption keys are shared.
- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensure robust separation of data using tenant IDs and access controls.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA in the US) for handling sensitive medical data.

## Scalability Considerations
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Use AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable hosting.
- **Containerization**: Deploy with Docker and Kubernetes for flexibility.
- **Message Queues**: Use RabbitMQ or Kafka for async processing to handle large workloads.

## Best Practices
Based on industry insights ([Top Backend Frameworks](https://slashdev.io/blog/top-backend-frameworks-for-llm-integration-in-2025)):
- Understand the LLM model’s capabilities and limitations.
- Choose a framework suited to the team’s expertise (e.g., FastAPI for Python, Node.js for JavaScript).
- Optimize data flow between the backend and LLM model.
- Implement robust error handling and security measures.
- Monitor and scale performance as needed.

## Conclusion
Backend engineers will play a critical role in building a secure, scalable system for processing prescription data using an LLM model. By developing APIs, integrating with the LLM model’s API, ensuring data privacy, and supporting both sync and async requests, they will enable hospitals to access extracted data efficiently while maintaining compliance with security and privacy requirements.
